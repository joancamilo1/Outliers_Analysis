# interquartile range (IQR)
Outliers analysis using the interquartile range (IQR) is a method commonly employed in statistics to identify and potentially remove or investigate extreme values in a dataset.

Here's how it works:

## Understanding Quartiles:
Quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts.

The first quartile (Q1) represents the 25th percentile, meaning 25% of the data points fall below this value.

The third quartile (Q3) represents the 75th percentile, indicating that 75% of the data points fall below this value.

##Calculating the Interquartile Range (IQR):
The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), i.e., IQR = Q3 - Q1.

## Identifying Outliers:
Outliers are typically defined as data points that lie below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.

A data point below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR is considered a mild outlier.

Extreme outliers can be defined as data points below Q1 - 3 * IQR or above Q3 + 3 * IQR.

## Handling Outliers:
### Once outliers are identified, you have several options:

Removing outliers: Sometimes outliers are due to errors in data collection or entry and can be safely removed.

Investigating outliers: Outliers might represent valid but rare occurrences or anomalies that merit further investigation.

Transforming data: If outliers significantly affect the distribution of your data, you may choose to transform your data (e.g., using logarithmic transformation) to mitigate their impact.

## Visualizing Outliers:
Outliers can also be visualized using box plots, where outliers are represented as individual points outside the "whiskers" of the plot.


### By using the interquartile range method, you can systematically identify potential outliers in your dataset and make informed decisions about how to handle them based on the context of your analysis.
